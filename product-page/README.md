# Survey Form

## Description
This project is a product page for the Nike Air Max 90, and it's part of the Responsive Web Design Projects for the Free Code Camp Certification.

## Objective

Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/RKRbwL.

Fulfill the below user stories and get all of the tests to pass. Give it your own personal style.

You can use HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to complete this project. Plain CSS is recommended because that is what the lessons have covered so far and you should get some practice with plain CSS. You can use Bootstrap or SASS if you choose. Additional technologies (just for example jQuery, React, Angular, or Vue) are not recommended for this project, and using them is at your own risk. Other projects will give you a chance to work with different technology stacks like React. We will accept and try to fix all issue reports that use the suggested technology stack for this project. Happy coding!

## Requirements

* The product landing page should have a header element with a corresponding id="header".
* an image within the header element with a corresponding id="header-img". A company logo would make a good image here.
* Within the #header element include a nav element with a corresponding id="nav-bar".
* There's at least three clickable elements inside the nav element, each with the class nav-link.
* When the user clicks in a .nav-link button in the nav element, I am taken to the corresponding section of the landing page.
* There's an embedded product video with id="video".
* The landing page has a form element with a corresponding id="form".
* Within the form, there is an input field with id="email" where I can enter an email address.
* The #email input field should have placeholder text to let the user know what the field is for.
* The #email input field uses HTML5 validation to confirm that the entered text is an email address.
* Within the form, there is a submit input with a corresponding id="submit".
* When I click the #submit element, the email is submitted to a static page (use this mock URL: https://www.freecodecamp.com/email-submit).
* The navbar should always be at the top of the viewport.
* The product landing page should have at least one media query.
* The product landing page should utilize CSS flexbox at least once.
